loudness_monitor.hpp: Missing #include <mutex>
audio_meters.hpp: Missing #include <mutex> 
quality_dashboard.hpp: Missing #include <mutex>
```

#### 2. AudioFrame Interface Mismatch
```cpp
// Expected in headers:
AudioFrame(const float* data, size_t samples, int channels, int sample_rate);

// Implementation expects:
AudioFrame(const int16_t* data, size_t frames, AudioFormat format);
```

#### 3. Dependency Chain Issues
- Quality Dashboard depends on Audio Meters
- Audio Meters depend on Loudness Monitor

```cpp
// Standardize on this interface:
class AudioFrame {
public:
    AudioFrame(const float* data, size_t samples, int channels, int sample_rate);
    // Ensure consistent usage across all components
};
```

#### 3. Fix Dependency Chain
