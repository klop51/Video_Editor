- (M#) = Milestone tag candidate
- DR = Decision Record reference (see `DECISIONS.md` once created)

## 0. Foundation & Tooling (Weeks 0â€“2)
Goals: Compile skeleton, logging, media probe, CI baseline.
Deliverables:
1. CMake project with warnings-as-errors & per-module targets. (Exit: `cmake --build` succeeds clean)
2. vcpkg integration (FFmpeg, spdlog, fmt, Catch2). (Exit: cache restore in CI < 5 min)
3. Media probe CLI: list streams, codec, duration, color primaries. (Exit: `media_probe sample.mp4` JSON output)
4. Logging subsystem (`core/log.h`) with structured + text sinks.
5. Basic Continuous Integration: build + run unit tests on Windows.
Risks & Mitigation:
- FFmpeg linkage complexity â†’ pin known version; add DR once chosen.
- Toolchain differences â†’ create `ci/toolchain.cmake`.

KPIs:
- Clean build time (Debug) â‰¤ 3 min on ref dev box.
- Media probe completes on 10 sample files w/o crash.

## 1. Decode & Playback Prototype (Weeks 2â€“6) (M0.1-prototype)
Goals: Decode single clip, present frames, measure baseline perf.
Deliverables:
1. `media_io` demux abstraction returning packets.
2. `decode` module: software video decode (H.264) to CPU RGBA buffers.
3. Minimal playback loop (headless or console FPS counter).
4. Frame timing & basic drop strategy (log when behind > 2 frames).
5. Performance capture harness writing JSON metrics.
Stretch: Hardware decode abstraction stub.
Exit Criteria:
- 4K30 H.264 clip decodes & plays â‰¥ 28 fps average (software path) on ref GPU/CPU.
- No memory leaks (validated by instrumentation / ASAN locally on Linux later).

Risks:
- Frame conversion cost â†’ introduce sws_scale baseline; later SIMD path.

## 2. Timeline & Command System (Weeks 6â€“9)
Goals: Immutable snapshot timeline model + edit operations programmatic.
Deliverables:
1. Core data structures (`timeline/`): Track, Segment, Timeline, Project.
2. Command pattern with undo/redo + coalescing policy.
3. Basic edit ops: insert clip, ripple delete, blade.
4. Unit tests for time math & edit invariants (no overlap, ordering).
5. Serialization draft (JSON) for simple project with 1â€“2 tracks.
Exit Criteria:
- 100% unit tests for timeline core pass.
- Insert + ripple delete p95 latency < 3 ms (synthetic 1000 segment track).

## 3. Early UI Shell (Weeks 9â€“12)
Goals: Qt window, playback surface, basic transport controls.
Deliverables:
1. Qt app skeleton (app layer initialization, logging panel).
2. Render surface placeholder (CPU blit; GPU later).
3. Transport: open media, play/pause, current time display.
4. Central event loop integration with playback thread.
5. Crash recovery stub (session autosave timer writing checkpoint JSON).
Exit Criteria:
- User can open a clip & play/pause with stable UI (< 5% dropped input events under playback load).

## 4. GPU & Render Graph Foundation (Weeks 12â€“16) (M0.5-playback)
Goals: Introduce GPU path & simple render graph.
Deliverables:
1. Chosen graphics API abstraction decision (DR#GPU-API).
2. Swapchain & frame pacing control (vsync toggle).
3. Upload decoded frames to GPU textures.
4. Basic shader pipeline (YUVâ†’linear, simple brightness effect).
5. Hash-based node memoization skeleton.
Exit Criteria:
- Brightness effect applied in real time to 4K30 clip w/ â‰¤ 14 ms avg frame render.

## 5. Frame & Decode Caching (Weeks 16â€“19)
Goals: Smooth scrubbing & playback resilience.
Deliverables:
1. Decode lookahead queue with priority (playhead Â± range).
2. RAM frame cache (LRU + size budget config).
3. Cache metrics reporting (hit ratio, evictions).
4. Configurable proxy generation stub (no transcode yet) returning scaled decode.
Exit Criteria:
- Scrub latency (seek to new position) first frame < 120 ms average.
- Frame cache hit ratio â‰¥ 60% during linear playback.

## 6. Basic Editing UI & Keyframes (Weeks 19â€“23)
Goals: Visual timeline, selection, trim tools, keyframe curves for one effect.
Deliverables:
1. Timeline panel (tracks stacked, segments drawn, basic zoom).
2. Mouse interactions: select, drag, blade.
3. Trim operations hooking commands.
4. Keyframe curve editor for brightness parameter.
5. Undo visualization (history panel).
Exit Criteria:
- Perform 50 mixed edits w/o crash; undo stack integrity verified.

## 7. Effects & Transitions Set (Weeks 23â€“27)
Goals: Initial library of core effects/transitions.
Deliverables:
1. Effects: transform (position/scale/rotate), opacity, crop, LUT apply, Gaussian blur, sharpen.
2. Transition: crossfade + wipe (direction param).
3. Effect parameter animation generalized from brightness.
4. Render graph optimization pass (fuse color ops).
Exit Criteria:
- Chain of 5 effects + 1 transition on 4K clip real-time â‰¥ 24 fps.

## 8. Audio Engine & Waveforms (Weeks 27â€“31) (M0.8-audio)
Goals: Basic audio decode, mixing, waveform display.
Deliverables:
1. Audio decode path (shared design with video for demux).
2. Mixing graph (gain/pan nodes) + master output via OS backend (WASAPI initial).
3. Waveform extraction pipeline w/ multi-resolution tiles.
4. Audio-driven master clock adoption & A/V sync test.
5. Basic meters in UI.
Exit Criteria:
- A/V sync drift < 10 ms over 10 min playback test.

## 9. Export Pipeline (Weeks 31â€“35)
Goals: Encode timeline to H.264/HEVC + WAV.
Deliverables:
1. Render to export graph (separate from interactive preview) w/ progress callbacks.
2. x264 software encode integration; HEVC optional if available.
3. Audio encode (AAC or PCM/WAV initially depending on licensing choice).
4. Preset system (quality, bitrate, resolution scaling, FPS conversion).
5. Cancel & resume (checkpoint segments or GOP boundaries) stretch.
Exit Criteria:
- Export 60s 4K clip @ target bitrate; real-time factor â‰¥ 0.7Ã— (software) reference.

## 10. Proxy & Performance Tuning (Weeks 35â€“39) (M1.0-mvp Candidate)
