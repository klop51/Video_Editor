# Step 7 Crash Analysis Report for ChatGPT
**Date:** September 23, 2025  
**Project:** Qt6 Video Editor - Critical SIGABRT Crash Investigation  
**Status:** Step 7 - Late Threading/Concurrency Crash After UI Success

---

## Executive Summary

We have a **Step 7 late SIGABRT crash** occurring after successful Qt operations in our video editor. This is a **thread safety/concurrency issue** between video decoding and UI painting operations. Our previous UiUpdateGuard successfully eliminated immediate synchronous crashes, but revealed this deeper concurrency problem.

**Critical Need:** Expert analysis of the thread safety patterns between FFmpeg video decoding and Qt UI operations.

---

## Technical Context

### System Architecture
- **Framework:** Qt6 with FFmpeg integration
- **Platform:** Windows (MSVC debug build)
- **Threading:** Multi-threaded video decoding + Qt UI main thread
- **Issue Type:** Late SIGABRT during concurrent video/UI operations

### Previous Success
- ✅ **UiUpdateGuard Implementation:** Eliminated immediate synchronous UI crashes
- ✅ **Step 6→7 Progression:** Successfully moved from immediate crashes to late crashes
- ✅ **Qt Operations Working:** All paint/flush operations completing successfully

---

## Current Crash Pattern

### Timing Analysis
```
19:44:03.425 - Multiple successful frame processing operations
19:44:03.442 - Frame decode starts (1080x1920, YUV420P)
19:44:03.443 - decode_packet successful
19:44:03.444 - VideoFrame buffer allocation (3110400 bytes)
19:44:03.445 - YUV420P planes copying (Y→U→V)
19:44:03.446 - AVFrame unreferenced after VideoFrame creation
19:44:03.450 - Frame processing delay applied
[Multiple Qt paint operations success]
[CRASH] SIGABRT - Late crash during UI operations
```

### Interleaved Operations (Critical Pattern)
```
[info] DEBUG: YUV420P Y plane copied, starting U plane
qt.widgets.painting: Marking QRect(0,0 1200x21) of QStatusBar dirty...
[info] DEBUG: YUV420P U plane copied, starting V plane  
qt.widgets.painting: Syncing dirty widgets
[info] DEBUG: AVFrame unreferenced after VideoFrame creation
qt.widgets.painting: Drawing QRegion(0,814 1200x21)...
[CRASH] SIGABRT
```

**Key Observation:** Video decoding and Qt painting are happening **concurrently** with potential race conditions.

---

## Code Investigation Areas

### 1. FFmpeg Frame Management
**Location:** `src/decode/src/video_decoder_ffmpeg.cpp`

**Critical Section:**
```cpp
// Frame processing with AVFrame lifecycle
[info] DEBUG: About to return VideoFrame from read_video()
[info] DEBUG: VideoFrame size: 3110400 bytes (2 MB)
[info] DEBUG: AVFrame unreferenced after VideoFrame creation
```

**Questions:**
- Is `AVFrame unreferenced` happening while Qt is still accessing the data?
- Are we safely managing the VideoFrame→Qt buffer handoff?
- Thread safety of FFmpeg frame lifecycle vs Qt painting?

### 2. Qt UI Thread Safety
**Pattern:** Concurrent Qt painting operations during video processing

**Evidence:**
```
qt.widgets.painting: Syncing dirty widgets
qt.widgets.painting: Drawing QRegion(0,814 1200x21) of ve::ui::MainWindow
qt.widgets.painting: Flushing QRegion(0,814 1200x21) to QWidgetWindow
```

**Questions:**
- Are video frames being displayed while still being processed?
- Cross-thread access to UI elements during video operations?
- Timer-based UI updates conflicting with video frame updates?

### 3. UiUpdateGuard Integration
**Current Protection:** 
```cpp
// src/ui/UiUpdateGuard.h - Working for sync crashes
std::atomic<bool> pending{false};
QMetaObject::invokeMethod for thread-safe updates
```

**Gap Analysis:**
- UiUpdateGuard works for immediate sync crashes
- May not cover **late async operations** during video playback
- Need extension for concurrent video/UI operations?

## Specific Technical Questions for ChatGPT

### Thread Safety Analysis
1. **FFmpeg + Qt Threading:** What are the safest patterns for FFmpeg frame processing with Qt UI updates?
2. **Buffer Lifecycle:** How to safely manage VideoFrame buffers between decode thread and UI thread?
3. **AVFrame Unreferencing:** When is it safe to unreference AVFrame when Qt might still need the data?

### Concurrency Patterns
1. **Video Display Pipeline:** What's the recommended Qt pattern for displaying video frames from background threads?
2. **UI Update Coordination:** How to coordinate timer-based UI updates with video frame updates?
3. **Cross-Thread Communication:** Best practices for video decoder → UI communication in Qt?

### Race Condition Investigation
1. **Critical Sections:** What critical sections need protection in video decode → display pipeline?
2. **Qt Paint Thread Safety:** Are there Qt painting operations that aren't thread-safe?
3. **Resource Sharing:** How to safely share video frame data between threads?

## Current Code Structure

### Video Decoder (Background Thread)
```cpp
// src/decode/src/video_decoder_ffmpeg.cpp
std::optional<VideoFrame> read_video() {
    // Frame processing on decode thread
    AVFrame processing → VideoFrame creation → AVFrame unreference
    // Potential race: UI thread accessing while unreferencing?
}
```

### UI Updates (Main Thread)
```cpp
// src/ui/src/main_window.cpp
// Timer-based position updates
position_update_timer_ = new QTimer(this);
connect(position_update_timer_, &QTimer::timeout, this, &MainWindow::update_playback_position);

// UiUpdateGuard for sync protection
if (!ui_update_guard_.tryUpdate()) return; // Working for immediate crashes
```

### Paint Operations (Main Thread)
```
qt.widgets.painting: Multiple paint/flush operations
// All completing successfully, crash happens AFTER success
```
