## Technical Debt / Gaps (Top 10)
1. No GPU render path or effect DAG ‚Äî blocks effects, transitions, color.
2. Missing keyframe system ‚Äî blocks animated parameters.
3. No audio mixing graph or master-clock enforcement ‚Äî limits A/V sync fidelity. 
4. Lack of export pipeline. 
5. No proxy or adaptive playback quality system. 
6. Missing advanced trim / slip / slide / roll commands. 
7. No autosave / crash recovery. 
8. Insufficient caching policies & memory pressure response. 
9. Absence of performance metrics aggregation & KPIs. 
10. Enforcement tooling for DR policies (no-throw audit script, time normalization use) incomplete.

## Near-Term Strategic Focus
Establish vertical slice from decode ‚Üí timeline edit ‚Üí (shim) render path ‚Üí audio ‚Üí export. GPU work temporarily slowed by MSVC namespace/compiler conflicts (see Risk Watch); focus on de-risking playback correctness & profiling while isolating graphics issues.

## Upcoming Sprints (Assuming 2-week cadence)

### Sprint 1 (Current ‚Üí +2 weeks) : "Foundations for Visual & Audio Pipeline"
Objectives:
- Decide & record DR: GPU API abstraction choice (DONE: DR-0001).
- Introduce minimal render graph interface (Node, RenderContext, hash placeholder) (PARTIAL: basic graph + nodes placeholder, no context yet).
- Implement YUV‚Üílinear upload + simple passthrough/transform shader (even if mocked CPU for now if GPU deferred).
- Audio engine: basic decode ‚Üí mixing to null/output sink; adopt audio as master clock in playback controller.
- Command coalescing (drag move/trim) simple time-threshold.
- Create DRs: dependency manager (vcpkg), timebase rationale, exception policy draft (DONE: DR-0002 accepted earlier, DR-0003, DR-0004 proposed).
- Add PROGRESS.md (done) + baseline performance JSON aggregator capturing frame decode & edit op timings.
Acceptance Criteria (updated progress inline):
- Render graph can request a frame through a node chain (even 2 nodes) returning a texture/placeholder. (NOT YET: stub only)
- Audio playback of single track synchronized within <50 ms drift vs video over 60s test (manual acceptable). (PENDING)
- Coalesced undo reduces drag sequence commands by >80% in synthetic test. (PENDING)
- GFX Vulkan bootstrap stub builds even without Vulkan SDK (DONE).
- expected<T,E> utility in core for exception-free APIs (DONE).
- Time rational normalize() + tests (DONE).
- Playback controller advances time on cache hits (FIXED: regression resolved 2025-08-27; added tests increasing assertion count).

### Sprint 2 (+2 ‚Üí +4 weeks) : "Effects & Keyframes Seed"
Objectives:
- Keyframe curve structure (linear interpolation) & evaluation API.
- Implement transform + opacity effects as render nodes using keyframes.
- Crossfade transition node integration (timeline insertion model + render blending).
- Performance aggregation enhancements: export JSON includes p95 frame time & edit latencies.
- Extend timeline commands: ripple trim (edge extend + ripple), roll edit skeleton.
- Begin waveform extraction (CPU downsample) & store tiles to memory (no disk persistence yet).
Acceptance Criteria:
- Keyframed opacity on a clip renders varying alpha over time.
- Crossfade between two adjacent segments renders expected blend (manual QA).
- p95 frame render metrics generated after a scripted playback session.

### Sprint 3 (+4 ‚Üí +6 weeks) : "Export & Proxy Introduction"
Objectives:
- Export pipeline: offline frame pull + encode stub (write sequential raw frames or integrate x264 if ready).
- Proxy generation stub: background task creates 1/4 res frames (CPU scale) for opened media; selection logic chooses proxy if available.
- Add slip & slide edit commands with invariants tests.
- Implement basic frame cache LRU capacity with eviction metrics.
- Autosave timer writing project JSON snapshot; manual recovery path.
- DR: Proxy policy & file layout.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Export produces playable MP4 (if encoder integrated) OR raw frame sequence & WAV (if not yet grouped) for 10s test timeline.
- Proxy chosen automatically when toggled to "performance" mode; log indicates switch.
- Autosave file appears at interval and can be loaded after simulated crash.

## Risk Watch (Current Top)
| Risk | Status | Mitigation Next Step |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| GPU path delay stalls effects (MSVC namespace conflicts in gfx) | Elevated | Isolate gfx build, reproduce in minimal TU, consider temporary rename of namespace &/or switch to Vulkan SDK validation branch |
| Audio engine complexity underestimated | Open | Start minimal mixing + master clock early (Sprint 1) |
| Lack of metrics hides regressions | Open | Add JSON profiling aggregator Sprint 1 |
| Export licensing (x264/x265) | Open | Start with software x264; isolate licensing in DR |

## Decision Records Status
| DR ID | Topic | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| DR-0001 | GPU API choice / abstraction scope | Proposed |
| DR-0002 | Dependency manager (vcpkg) | Accepted |
| DR-0003 | Exception & error handling policy | Proposed |
| DR-0004 | Rational timebase strategy | Proposed |
| DR-0005 | Proxy asset storage & invalidation strategy | Planned |

## Maintenance Instructions
- Update status table when a row advances (replace symbol, add concise note with date).
- Close the top risks or move to an archive section when mitigated.
- After each sprint, append a short "Sprint N Outcome" subsection (3‚Äì5 bullets) before defining the next sprint.

---
Ownership: Update alongside major feature PRs; reviewers ensure consistency with `ARCHITECTURE.md` & `ROADMAP.md`.

### Sprint 0 Outcome (Bootstrap)
- Extended timeline invariants; initial test suite green (155 assertions then, now 214 after added playback & profiling tests).
- Established DR framework with initial records (GPU, exceptions, timebase, vcpkg).
- Added `expected` utility & enforced no-throw policy note in `.clang-tidy`.
- Implemented time rational normalization + tests.
- Introduced `gfx` module with Vulkan bootstrap stubs compiling w/o SDK.
- Fixed early playback stagnation bug (time not advancing on cache hits) prior to Sprint 1 objectives ‚Äì increased reliability baseline.
