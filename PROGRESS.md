## Near-Term Strategic Focus
Establish vertical slice from decode ‚Üí timeline edit ‚Üí (shim) render path ‚Üí audio ‚Üí export. GPU namespace issue resolved; shift to wiring render graph & initial audio engine stub plus performance metric aggregation.

## Upcoming Sprints (Assuming 2-week cadence)

### Sprint 1 (Current ‚Üí +2 weeks) : "Foundations for Visual & Audio Pipeline"
Objectives:
- Decide & record DR: GPU API abstraction choice (DONE: DR-0001).
- Introduce minimal render graph interface (Node, RenderContext, hash placeholder) (PARTIAL: basic graph + nodes placeholder, no context yet).
- Implement YUV‚Üílinear upload + simple passthrough/transform shader (even if mocked CPU for now if GPU deferred).
- Audio engine: basic decode ‚Üí mixing to null/output sink; adopt audio as master clock in playback controller.
- Command coalescing (drag move/trim) simple time-threshold.
- Create DRs: dependency manager (vcpkg), timebase rationale, exception policy draft (DONE: DR-0002 accepted earlier, DR-0003, DR-0004 proposed).
- Add PROGRESS.md (done) + baseline performance JSON aggregator capturing frame decode & edit op timings.
Acceptance Criteria (updated progress inline):
- Render graph can request a frame through a node chain (even 2 nodes) returning a texture/placeholder. (NOT YET: stub only)
- Audio playback of single track synchronized within <50 ms drift vs video over 60s test (manual acceptable). (PENDING)
- Coalesced undo reduces drag sequence commands by >80% in synthetic test. (PENDING)
- GFX Vulkan bootstrap stub builds even without Vulkan SDK (DONE).
- expected<T,E> utility in core for exception-free APIs (DONE).
- Time rational normalize() + tests (DONE).
- Playback controller advances time on cache hits (FIXED: regression resolved 2025-08-27; added tests increasing assertion count).
- Playback controller instrumented with profiling scopes (cache_hit, decode_video, decode_audio, dispatch callbacks) feeding `profiling.json`.

### Sprint 2 (+2 ‚Üí +4 weeks) : "Effects & Keyframes Seed"
Objectives:
- Keyframe curve structure (linear interpolation) & evaluation API.
- Implement transform + opacity effects as render nodes using keyframes.
- Crossfade transition node integration (timeline insertion model + render blending).
- Performance aggregation enhancements: export JSON includes p95 frame time & edit latencies.
- Extend timeline commands: ripple trim (edge extend + ripple), roll edit skeleton.
- Begin waveform extraction (CPU downsample) & store tiles to memory (no disk persistence yet).
Acceptance Criteria:
- Keyframed opacity on a clip renders varying alpha over time.
- Crossfade between two adjacent segments renders expected blend (manual QA).
- p95 frame render metrics generated after a scripted playback session.

### Sprint 3 (+4 ‚Üí +6 weeks) : "Export & Proxy Introduction"
Objectives:
- Export pipeline: offline frame pull + encode stub (write sequential raw frames or integrate x264 if ready).
- Proxy generation stub: background task creates 1/4 res frames (CPU scale) for opened media; selection logic chooses proxy if available.
- Add slip & slide edit commands with invariants tests.
- Implement basic frame cache LRU capacity with eviction metrics.
- Autosave timer writing project JSON snapshot; manual recovery path.
- DR: Proxy policy & file layout.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Export produces playable MP4 (if encoder integrated) OR raw frame sequence & WAV (if not yet grouped) for 10s test timeline.
- Proxy chosen automatically when toggled to "performance" mode; log indicates switch.
- Autosave file appears at interval and can be loaded after simulated crash.

## Risk Watch (Current Top)
| Risk | Status | Mitigation Next Step |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| GPU path delay stalls effects (namespace conflict) | Resolved 2025-08-29 | Guards + minimal TU test in CI; proceed with Vulkan bootstrap & node prototypes |
| Audio engine complexity underestimated | Open | Start minimal mixing + master clock early (Sprint 1) |
| Lack of metrics hides regressions | Open | Add JSON profiling aggregator Sprint 1 |
| Export licensing (x264/x265) | Open | Start with software x264; isolate licensing in DR |

## Decision Records Status
| DR ID | Topic | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| DR-0001 | GPU API choice / abstraction scope | Proposed |
| DR-0002 | Dependency manager (vcpkg) | Accepted |
| DR-0003 | Exception & error handling policy | Proposed |
| DR-0004 | Rational timebase strategy | Proposed |
| DR-0005 | Proxy asset storage & invalidation strategy | Planned |

## Maintenance Instructions
- Update status table when a row advances (replace symbol, add concise note with date).
- Close the top risks or move to an archive section when mitigated.
- After each sprint, append a short "Sprint N Outcome" subsection (3‚Äì5 bullets) before defining the next sprint.

---
Ownership: Update alongside major feature PRs; reviewers ensure consistency with `ARCHITECTURE.md` & `ROADMAP.md`.

### Sprint 0 Outcome (Bootstrap)
- Extended timeline invariants; initial test suite green (155 assertions then, now 214 after added playback & profiling tests).
- Established DR framework with initial records (GPU, exceptions, timebase, vcpkg).
- Added `expected` utility & enforced no-throw policy note in `.clang-tidy`.
- Implemented time rational normalization + tests.
- Introduced `gfx` module with Vulkan bootstrap stubs compiling w/o SDK.
- Fixed early playback stagnation bug (time not advancing on cache hits) prior to Sprint 1 objectives ‚Äì increased reliability baseline.
